- Connects two or more LANs at the [Link Layer](OSI%20layers/Link%20Layer/Link%20Layer.md)
	1. Extracts destination address from the frame
	2. Looks up destination in table
	3. Forwards frame to appropriate segment
- Each segment can carry its own traffic
- Similar to [Switches](OSI%20layers/Link%20Layer/Switches.md)
