- End-to-end resources allocated to and reserved for "calls" between source and destination
	- Commonly used in traditional telephone networks
- Make a physical circuit between transmitter and receiver

Pros:
- Circuit-like performance
Cons:
- Needs dedicated circuit for each connection
  - Doesn't allow multi-tasking (can only connect to one website)
  - This is a deal-breaker
- Circuit segment idle if there is not enough data

So this is not appropriate for the Internet - we use [Packet switching](OSI%20layers/Link%20layer/Packet%20switching.md) instead
