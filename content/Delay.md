Four sources of delay if you use [packet switching](Packet%20switching.md):
  - Transmission delay: How fast the router can send data to the network
  - Limited bandwidth (bits per second) is biggest cause of transmission delay
    - Packet length is another factor (bits)
    - Transmission delay = packet length divided by link bandwidth
  - Nodal processing delay
    - Check bit errors
    - Determine output link
    - Typically < msec
  - Queueing delay: Time waiting at output link for transmission
  - Propagation delay: length of physical link divided by propagation speed
