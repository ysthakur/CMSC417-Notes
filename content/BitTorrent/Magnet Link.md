Magnet links allow you to create a swarm without a [Tracker](BitTorrent/Tracker.md)
- Need to use a [Distributed Hash Table](Distributed%20Hash%20Table.md)

The magnet link identifies a torrent using an **infohash** (the SHA-1 hash of the [torrent file](BitTorrent/Torrent%20Files.md))

==TODO take more notes on this==
