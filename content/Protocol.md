- A protocol defines:
    - Format
    - Order of messages sent and received
    - Actions taken on message transmission
    - Receipt
- e.g. TCP
- If there's no controller to monitor what's going on and one of the computers involved stops following the protocol, then
    - that malfunctioning computer's messages may just be discarded
    - but it may disrupt other computers' communications
- Want to set up protocols so they discourage bad behavior/protect other computers from bad computers
