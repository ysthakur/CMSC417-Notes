## Address 3

![A host H1 connected to an access point (AP) connected to a router R1](WiFi/addr3-case1.png)

### Case 1: Router R1 sends data to host H1

1. R1 knows H1's IP address, runs ARP to get MAC address
2. R1 encapsulates the data in Ethernet frame
	- Source address: R1's MAC address
	- Destination address: H1's MAC address
3. AP converts the Ethernet frame to WiFi frame
	- Address 1: H1's MAC address
	- Address 2: AP's MAC address
	- Address 3: R1's MAC address
4. H1 can determine that the frame has come from R1 by checking the Address 3 field

### Case 2: Host H1 responds by sending packet to router R1

1. H1 creates a WiFi frame
	- Address 1: AP's MAC address
	- Address 2: H1's MAC address
	- Address 3: R1's MAC address
2. AP can determine that the frame should be forwarded to R1 by checking Address 3 field
3. AP converts the WiFi frame to Ethernet frame
	- Source address: H1's MAC address
	- Destination address: R1's MAC address
