## Networks Overview

## Routing Protocols

## [IP](IP/IP.md)

Problem solving for
1. Network delay, throughput, bandwidth
2. IP addresses and subnetting
3. IP fragmentation and reassembly
4. Routing protocols

## [Transport Layer](OSI%20layers/Transport%20Layer.md) multiplexing and demultiplexing
## [UDP](UDP.md)
## [TCP](TCP/TCP.md)

Problem solving questions on:
1. [CIDR](IP/CIDR.md), [ICMP](ICMP/ICMP.md), [Traceroute](ICMP/Traceroute.md)
2. 3-way handshake for TCP
3. Calculating header fields for TCP segments/packets and ACKs
4. Throughput calculation for ARQ
5. Calculating advertised window
6. Observing congestion window behavior

## Link layer protocols (Chapters 2, 3, 4)

## Intra-AS routing and Inter-AS routing, [BGP](Inter-Domain%20Routing/BGP.md)

## Security issues in BGP networks

## Application layer protocols

## Problem-Solving type questions

- Ethernet, CSMA/CD
- Wireless channel sharing
- Learning bridge, repeater, hub, switch, and router
- BGP protocol and attacks
- DNS
