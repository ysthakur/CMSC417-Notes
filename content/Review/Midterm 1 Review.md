1. Networks Overview (Chapter 1)
	1. Basic components of a computer network (Section: 1.2.2)
		- [Switches](../OSI%20layers/Link%20layer/Switches.md)
		- [Switches vs routers](../Switch%20vs%20Router.md)
		- ==TODO review==
	2. Interconnection, internet, the Internet (Section: 1.2.2)
		- [Internet](../Internet.md)
		==TODO review==
	3. Importance and challenges of computer networks (Refer to class slides and notes)
		==TODO review==
	4. Network architecture, abstractions, and protocol stacks/layers (Section: 1.3)
		- [OSI Architecture](../OSI%20layers/OSI%20Architecture.md)
		==TODO review==
	5. Resource sharing, [Circuit switching](../OSI%20layers/Link%20layer/Circuit%20switching.md) and [Packet switching](../OSI%20layers/Link%20layer/Packet%20switching.md) (Section: 1.2.3)
		==TODO review==
	6. [Network edge](../Network%20edge.md) and [Network core](../Network%20core.md) (Refer to class slides and notes)
		==TODO review==
	7. Access networks (Refer to class slides and notes)
		- [Home Networks](../Home%20Networks.md)
		- [Ethernet](../OSI%20layers/Link%20layer/Ethernet/Ethernet.md)
		- [WANs](../WANs.md)
		==TODO review==
	8. [Failures](Failures), [Delay](../Delay.md), [Throughput](../Throughput.md), [Bandwidth](../Bandwidth.md) (Section: 1.2.4, 1.5)
		- Latency/delay is like length of pipe
		- Bandwidth is like cross-sectional area of pipe
		- [Bandwidth vs Throughput](../Bandwidth%20vs%20Throughput.md)
			- Both are in bps
		- ==TODO review delay==
2. Routing Protocols (Chapter 3, Section: 3.3)

3. Internet Protocol (IP) (Chapter 3, Section: 3.2)
	1. Data plane and control plane (Refer to class slides and notes)
	2. IP datagram format (Section: 3.2.2)
	3. Fragmentation and reassembly (Section: 3.2.2)
	4. IPv4 address (Section: 3.2.3)
	5. IP datagram forwarding (Section: 3.2.4)

Expect “problem solving” type questions on:
1. IP fragmentation and reassembly
2. IP addresses and Subnetting
3. Routing protocols
