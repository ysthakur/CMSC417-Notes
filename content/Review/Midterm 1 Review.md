1. Networks Overview (Chapter 1)
	1. Basic components of a computer network (Section: 1.2.2)
		==TODO review==
	2. Interconnection, internet, the Internet (Section: 1.2.2)

Expect “problem solving” type questions on:
1. IP fragmentation and reassembly
2. IP addresses and Subnetting
3. Routing protocols
