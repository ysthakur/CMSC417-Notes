- [Bandwidth](Bandwidth.md) is the capacity at a particular point
- [Throughput](Throughput.md) is the reality, the rate at which data is actually transmitted

When data is being transmitted between two links, the throughput is whatever the smaller bandwidth is (the bandwidth of the bottleneck link)

==TODO check if this understanding of throughput is right==
