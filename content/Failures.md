Three general classes of failures:
- Bit errors
	- 1s turned into 0s or vice versa as packets transmitted over physical link
	- Sometimes single bit, but sometimes **burst error** (several consecutive bits)
	- Caused by lightning strikes, power surges, etc.
	- Thankfully, pretty rare
	- Can be detected and corrected
- Packets lost
	- Congested switches - No place left in queue
- Physical link cut or computer crashes
