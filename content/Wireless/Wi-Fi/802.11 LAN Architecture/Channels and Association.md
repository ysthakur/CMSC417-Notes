- Multiple channels at different frequencies
	- Network administrator chooses frequency for [Access Point](Wireless/Wi-Fi/802.11%20LAN%20Architecture/Access%20Point.md) (AP)
	- Interference if channel is same as neighboring AP
- Access Points send out periodic beacon frames
	- Containing AP's [SSID](Wireless/Wi-Fi/SSID.md) and [MAC Address](OSI%20layers/Link%20layer/MAC%20Address.md)
	- Host scans channels, listening for beacon frames
